# Towards-an-FPGA-Based-Dedicated-Computer-for-Molecular-Dynamics-Simulations

Code for an FPGA based dedicated computer for molecular dynamics simulations. 
For a detailed description, see preprint.pdf, to appear in the Journal of 
Chemical Physics.

\FPGA: Vivado project MD1.xpr as well as all Verilog files. Runs in Vivado

\HostComputer: Stand-alone C++ file MDcontrol.cpp, which needs to be imported 
as a project into Visual Studio  

\PCB: Printed Circuit Board used to set the IP of a node with the the help of 
a DIP switch, as well as to connect all nodes for synchronisation.
